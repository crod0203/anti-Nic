    <p>Kids’ developing brains are more susceptible to addiction and e-cigarettes essentially provide a smoke-free way to inhale nicotine, which is more addictive than heroin, cocaine or alcohol. Some brands of e-cigarettes contain a dangerously high level of nicotine – more than twice what is found in traditional cigarettes and other e-cigarettes. Nicotine mixed with a developing brain can lead to addiction, reduced impulse control and mood disorders.  Vapes contain<strong> many harmful</strong> metals like <i>nickel , tin and lead</i> which can contaminate your lungs.<br>E-cigarettes also contain acrolein, a herbicide primarily used to kill weeds. It can cause acute lung injury and COPD and may cause asthma and lung cancer. </p>
    <h2><u>What we know about the chemicals in vapes</u></h2>

        <li>An FDA analysis of e-cigarettes from two leading brands found that the samples contained carcinogens and other hazardous chemicals, including diethylene glycol, which is found in antifreeze. These chemicals are dangers for both adolescents and adults.</li>
        <li>A research group based in France found that e-cigarettes contain “potentially carcinogenic elements.”</li>
        <li>The British Medical Association, the World Health Organization and the United States Surgeon General have each issued warnings about the dangers that may be associated with e-cigarettes.</li>
