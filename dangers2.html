    <h1>Different diseases </h1>
    <p> While using vapes may be healthier than smoking traditional cigarettes, users <b>still face </b>health risks. E-cigarette use, or "vaping," has been linked to <b>lung, heart, brain, and gum</b> illnesses.Due to its fairly recent rise in popularity, unfortunately many of the <em>long-term </em>health effects of vaping have yet to be diagnosed and studied.But what is clear is that e-cigarettes have been found to have chemicals and particles that have been linked experimentally to lung disease, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Vaping can also cause lung inflammation, which has been linked to chronic lung disease as well.</p>
