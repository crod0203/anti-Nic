    <h1>Addittional breaking addiction information</h1>
    
    <p>The physical symptoms of nicotine addiction are <b>caused by withdrawal</b>. Withdrawal from nicotine occurs because the addicted brain can no longer naturally produce adequate levels of certain chemicals, like <i>dopamine</i>. This is Quitting is a free and anonymous text messaging program from Truth Initiative designed to help young people quit vaping. The program send teens messages from other young people like them who have attempted to, or successfully quit, vaping. To enroll in This is Quitting, teens and young adults text DITCHVAPE to 88709. The first messages they receive will ask for their age and product usage so that they are able to receive relevant messages.</p>
