    <h1>Breaking addictions</h1>
    <p>If you've picked up the habit of vaping nicotine, you might be rethinking things amid reports of vaping-related lung injuries, some of which are life threatening.Before starting the quitting process, you’ll also want to identify your triggers — the cues that make you want to vape. These can be physical, social, or emotional.
        Patterns in your use and feelings that trigger use are good things to be mindful of when you’re evaluating your relationship with a given substance or trying to make changes.
        Taking note of potential triggers as you plan to quit can help you develop a strategy to avoid or deal with these triggers.
        If your friends vape, for example, you might have a harder time quitting if you spend a lot of time with them but don’t consider how you’ll address the temptation to vape with them.
    </p>
    
    <p id="Triggers">Triggers can vary from person to person but common triggers are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li >emotions like stress, boredom, or loneliness</li>
        <li>doing something you connect to vaping, like hanging out with friends who vape or taking a break at work</li>
        <li>seeing other people vaping</li>
        <li>Expericencing withdrawal symptoms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you quit vaping, the first week (or two or three) might be a little rough.

        You might experience a combination of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mood changes, like increased irritability, nervousness, and frustration</li>
        <li>Feelings of anxiety or depression</li>
        <li>Tiredness</li>
        <li>Diffuctly sleeping</li>
        <li>Headaches</li>
        <li>Inceased anger</li>
        <li>Trounle focusing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As part of withdrawal, you’ll probably also experience cravings, or a strong urge to vape.
     Come up with a list of things you can do to deal with the craving in the moment, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Practicing deep breathing</li>
        <li>Trying a short meditation</li>
        <li>Taking a quick walk or step outside for a change of scenery</li>
        <li>Playing a game or solving a crossword or number puzzle</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One of the most important steps in the quitting process is finding support. Research shows that finding a community or support group helps raise the success rate of quitting and lowers the chances of relapse. <br>It’s important to have this conversation, though, even if it seems like it might be difficult.
        Friends and family who know you’re quitting can offer encouragement. Their support can make the withdrawal period easier to cope with.
        Sharing your decision also opens the door for a conversation about your boundaries. You might, for example ask friends not to vape around you or let friends know you’ll avoid places where people are vaping</p>
