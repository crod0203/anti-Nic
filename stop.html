    <h1>Breaking addictions</h1>
    <p>If you've picked up the habit of vaping nicotine, you might be rethinking things amid reports of vaping-related lung injuries, some of which are life threatening.Before starting the quitting process, you’ll also want to identify your triggers — the cues that make you want to vape. These can be physical, social, or emotional.</p>
    
    <p>Triggers can vary from person to person but common triggers are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>emotions like stress, boredom, or loneliness</li>
        <li>doing something you connect to vaping, like hanging out with friends who vape or taking a break at work</li>
        <li>seeing other people vaping</li>
        <li>Expericencing withdrawal symptoms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One of the most important steps in the quitting process is finding support. Research shows that finding a community or support group helps raise the success rate of quitting and lowers the chances of relapse. The <b>first </b>step is to <strong>allow yourself some time </strong>to think about what's motivating you to quit. Once you have a clear idea of why you want to quit, you're ready for <b>the next step</b>: choosing a start date.</p>
