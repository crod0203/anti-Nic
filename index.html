    <h1>The real poison is Vapes.</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> Recently Teens have been the primary victim to the dangers of the vape. Many new outlets and articles are surfacing about the countless teens harmed by vaping. E-cigarette use has become common, but there still seems to be a smoke screen concealing its true impact on health. A growing body of evidence shows that smoking e-cigarettes, or vaping, may be even more dangerous than smoking cigarettes.
     Vaping is the inhaling of a vapor created by an electronic cigarette or other vaping device.Vaping has become one of the more popular ways to consume both tobacco and marijuana. It consists of an atomizer, a power source such as a battery, and a container such as a cartridge or tank. Instead of smoke, the user inhales vapor. But, as with anything, with popularity comes added attention to the <strong>potential risks</strong>.At issue is what chemicals are contained in the liquid that is being vaporized and inhaled, and how they are affecting users — especially teens. More than one in nine high school seniors in the U.S. report vaping daily.

        Vaping simulates smoking. Battery-powered vape devices create an aerosol that looks like water vapor but contains nicotine, flavoring, and more than 30 other chemicals. The aerosol is inhaled into the lungs where the nicotine and chemicals cross over into the bloodstream.
        Vapes come in many shapes and sizes but they have the same basic components, including a battery, sensor and atomizer/ flavor cartridge. The e-liquid is quickly heated and converted to an aerosol that can be inhaled into the lungs.
        Cigarettes contain poisons, toxic metals and carcinogens that enter the body with every puff. Vapers also breathe in dangerous chemicals, such as acetone, which is used as a solvent. Acetone may irritate the skin and eyes when you come into contact with it. Other chemicals in vapes may cause cancer over time.
        Even though term ‘vapor’ is normally used, vape devices do not produce water vapor. Vaping produces an aerosol mist. Unlike water vapor, the aerosol mist includes ultra-fine particles that are breathed into the lungs
