    <h1>The real poison is Vapes.</h1>
    <p> E-cigarette use has become common, but there still seems to be a smoke screen concealing its true impact on health. A growing body of evidence shows that smoking e-cigarettes, or vaping, may be even more dangerous than smoking cigarettes.
     Vaping is the inhaling of a vapor created by an electronic cigarette or other vaping device.Vaping has become one of the more popular ways to consume both tobacco and marijuana. It consists of an atomizer, a power source such as a battery, and a container such as a cartridge or tank. Instead of smoke, the user inhales vapor. But, as with anything, with popularity comes added attention to the <strong>potential risks</strong>.At issue is what chemicals are contained in the liquid that is being vaporized and inhaled, and how they are affecting users â€” especially teens. More than one in nine high school seniors in the U.S. report vaping daily.
